                                <p>An entertaining and hypnotizing commentary on how effective fake news is and how it's perpetrated
                                
                                By literally showing the audience how Peter's reality can be invalidated/discredited/doubted because of powerful group of people.
                                
                                This movie sticks to its milennial roots by painting/building a mersmerizing display and subtly shwocasing the importance of truth in the current political climate
                                
                                Perception is the main villain in this movie
                                
                                New can do good and bad? While this tech could revolutionize therapy and help many deal with grief and training, it an also discredit people's views and perception of the world.
                                
                                Jounrnalism helps many uncover the truth of the world and allow the world to hear about major events, but in the wrong hands can lead to fake news being perpetuated and thrown around. Similar to Mysterio, people will continue to pedal their false agendas just like journalists being silenced to keep secrets,.
                                
                                Although we the milenialls and spiderman can feel spidey senses, our realities and perceptions can be shifted by powerful people around us.</p>
